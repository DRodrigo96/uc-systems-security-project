# RECOMMENDATIONS

# 1. Standard nomenclature for usernames
# Develop standard names for allowed users and delete those
# that do not follow the policy.
# Example of user another suspicious user found at server:
  $ ubuntu@ubuntu-VirtualBox:~$ cat /etc/passwd
  # voldemort:x:0:0::/home/voldemort:

# 2. Password manager and MFA authentication policy
# Stablish a policy related to the usage of a password
# manager for sensitive credential storage. Thus, enforce
# Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) for organization's users
# and apply its configuration on SSH servers.

# 3. IPs Whitelist
# Create a whitelist of IP address that are allowed to connect
# remotely through SSH.

# 4. Firewall policy
# Develop policy related to firewalls that help mitigate
# attacks.

# 5. Isolate service
# Configuration with regard to jailing the service
# in order to avoid isolate potential attacks.
